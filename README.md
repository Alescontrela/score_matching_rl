# Q-Score Matching RL (QSM)

## Overview

This repository provides the official implementation of the Q-Score Matching algorithm (QSM) for the paper ["Learning a Diffusion Model Policy from Rewards via Q-Score Matching"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11752) by Michael Psenka, Alejandro Escontrela, Pieter Abbeel, and Yi Ma. The setting for QSM is off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous state/action spaces, where the agent's policy is represented as a diffusion model. **The core of the QSM algorithm**: by iteratively aligning the denoising model of the policy with the action gradient of the critic $\nabla_a Q$, we can learn an optimal diffusion model policy by *only training against the denoiser model*, akin to standard diffusion model training, rather than having to backpropagate through the entire diffusion model evaluation. A straightforward idea, but one with interesting math behind it and surprising practical benefits (e.g. *naturally learns explorative agents*). Please see [the original paper](https://www.michaelpsenka.io/qsm/) for the theory and practical benefits of QSM.

Diffusion models have gained popularity in generative tasks due to their ability to represent complex distributions over continuous spaces. In the context of reinforcement learning, they offer both expressiveness and ease of sampling, making them a promising choice for policy representation. While many works have been done in the offline setting, the online/off-policy setting for diffusion model policies is still relatively underexplored.

The code is built on top of a re-implementation of the [jaxrl](https://github.com/ikostrikov/jaxrl) framework.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the required dependencies. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and a suitable GPU setup.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

For other versions of CUDA, follow the [JAX installation instructions](https://github.com/google/jax#pip-installation-gpu-cuda).

## Getting Started

To reproduce the results or to run the provided training scripts, navigate to the respective example directories and execute the provided training script:

```bash
cd examples/states
python3 train_score_matching_online.py
```

Script options can be found within the [training script file](examples/states/train_score_matching_online.py). For example, if you want to train on a different environment:

```bash
python3 train_score_matching_online.py --env_name walker_walk
```

## Important Files and Scripts

- **[Main Training Script](examples/states/train_score_matching_online.py)**: The main training script to train a diffusion model agent using QSM. Includes options for the environment and training scenario.

- **[QSM Learner](jaxrl5/agents/score_matching/score_matching_learner.py)**: The core implementation of the QSM algorithm, including methods for creating the learner, updating critic and actor networks, and sampling actions. **Note** that if you want to make any changes to the learner after installation, you will need to reinstall jaxrl5 locally, by running the following from the root directory of the repository:
```bash
pip install ./
```

- **[Training Configuration for Score Matching](examples/states/configs/score_matching_config.py)**: Configuration file for setting hyperparameters and model configurations for the QSM learner.

- **[DDPM Implementation](jaxrl5/networks/diffusion.py)**: Contains the implementation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Fourier Features, and various beta schedules essential for the score matching process.


## Usage Example

The [main training script](examples/states/train_score_matching_online.py) gives a minimal example for launching a QSM learning agent in an environment. Below is a slightly stripped down version to illustrate the usage of jaxrl5 and the QSM learner:

```python
import os
import jax
import gym
import tqdm
from absl import app, flags
from ml_collections import config_flags

from jaxrl5.agents import ScoreMatchingLearner
from jaxrl5.data import ReplayBuffer
from jaxrl5.evaluation import evaluate
from jaxrl5.wrappers import wrap_gym

FLAGS = flags.FLAGS

flags.DEFINE_string("env_name", "CartPole-v1", "Environment name.")
flags.DEFINE_integer("seed", 42, "Random seed.")
flags.DEFINE_integer("eval_episodes", 1, "Number of episodes used for evaluation.")
flags.DEFINE_integer("log_interval", 1000, "Logging interval.")
flags.DEFINE_integer("eval_interval", 10000, "Eval interval.")
flags.DEFINE_integer("batch_size", 256, "Mini batch size.")
flags.DEFINE_integer("max_steps", int(1e6), "Number of training steps.")
flags.DEFINE_integer("start_training", int(1e4), "Number of steps to start training.")
config_flags.DEFINE_config_file("config", "examples/states/configs/score_matching_config.py", "Training configuration file.")

def main(_):
    env = gym.make(FLAGS.env_name)
    env = wrap_gym(env, rescale_actions=True)
    env.seed(FLAGS.seed)
    
    eval_env = gym.make(FLAGS.env_name)
    eval_env = wrap_gym(eval_env, rescale_actions=True)
    eval_env.seed(FLAGS.seed + 42)

    config = FLAGS.config
    kwargs = dict(config)

    agent = ScoreMatchingLearner.create(FLAGS.seed, env.observation_space, env.action_space, **kwargs)
    replay_buffer = ReplayBuffer(env.observation_space, env.action_space, FLAGS.max_steps)
    replay_buffer.seed(FLAGS.seed)

    observation, done = env.reset(), False

    for step in tqdm.tqdm(range(1, FLAGS.max_steps + 1), smoothing=0.1):
        if step < FLAGS.start_training:
            action = env.action_space.sample()
        else:
            action, agent = agent.sample_actions(observation)
        
        next_observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)

        if not done or "TimeLimit.truncated" in info:
            mask = 1.0
        else:
            mask = 0.0

        replay_buffer.insert({
            "observations": observation,
            "actions": action,
            "rewards": reward,
            "masks": mask,
            "dones": done,
            "next_observations": next_observation
        })
        observation = next_observation

        if done:
            observation, done = env.reset(), False

        if step >= FLAGS.start_training:
            batch = replay_buffer.sample(FLAGS.batch_size)
            agent, _ = agent.update(batch)

        if step % FLAGS.log_interval == 0:
            print(f"Step: {step}")

        if step % FLAGS.eval_interval == 0:
            eval_info = evaluate(agent, eval_env, num_episodes=FLAGS.eval_episodes)
            print(f"Evaluation at step {step}: {eval_info}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(main)
```
